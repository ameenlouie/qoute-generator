# qoute-generator
This project is a Motivational Quote Generator, a command-line application that generates unique, inspiring quotes on any user-specified topic. It leverages a locally-run large language model to ensure privacy and eliminate reliance on external APIs.
Tools and Technologies Used
This project was built using the following key technologies:

Python: The core programming language used to write the application logic.

Ollama : A powerful tool that serves open-source large language models (LLMs) on a local machine. For this project, it was used to run the phi-3 model, which handled the quote generation.

LangChain : A comprehensive framework used to develop applications powered by language models. It simplified the process of creating prompts, interacting with the Ollama model, and parsing the output.

Git & GitHub: Git was used for local version control to track changes to the code. GitHub was used as a remote repository to store the project's source code and make it shareable for submission.
